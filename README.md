# DH 140 Assignment 09

### Instructions

Step 1: Choose one of your Jupyter notebooks from this quarter's other assignments.

Step 2: Create a new GitHub repository that contains this notebook, a README.md file, and a requirements.txt file.

- The README file should contain a clear description of what's in the notebook, it should be properly styled with markdown, and it should contain a badge to launch an interactive version of your repository on Binder.
- The requirements.txt file should contain the Python libraries necessary to execute your notebook.
- If your notebook requires any data files, they should also be added to the repository.
- When clicking on the Binder badge and being taken to the relevant Binder site, your notebook should run from start to finish without error.

Step 3: Add this notebook and requirements.txt file to your repository created with fastai/fastpages in class.

- Verify that the respective blog site contains the contents of your notebook.
  - Your notebook will need to be pushed to GitHub before the new notebook will appear.
- Hide at least one code cell and make at least one code cell collapsable.

Step 4: Make a very short Zoom recording in which you preview your blog site and show which code cell is hidden and which is collapsable.
